Now imagine it's your first day on the job at the company. You need to write a cover letter to introduce yourself to the team.

1. Write a letter to your coworkers introducing yourself. Think about the structure of the letter: who you are, what your name is, and what job you'll be doing. Think about what facts will be useful to your colleagues. At the end, it's great to add the phrase "I look forward to being of service to the company and to you.

Здравствуйте!
Меня зовут Фёдор, я новый сотрудник на должности младший бэкэнд-разработчик.
Буду рад познакомиться и быть полезным вам и компании.

2. Many companies will ask you to include a photo. Think carefully and include a photo that best represents you to the team.
